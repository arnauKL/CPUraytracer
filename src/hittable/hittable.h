// Class hittable: abstract class (blueprint). Francesc Castro would be proud rn.
// It represents any object that a ray might hit â€” e.g., a sphere, a plane, a triangle, etc.
// The key idea: you can store a *list* of 'hittable' objects (like spheres, planes)
// and test a ray against them *without* caring about which specific type they are.
//
// The trick: the 'hit' function is declared as *pure virtual*.
// This means each concrete shape must define its own version of how to check for a hit.
//
// This is polymorphism: code that uses 'hittable' doesn't care if it's a sphere or something else.
// It just calls 'hit' and the right version runs.
//
// 'virtual' means "this function can be overridden in derived classes".
// '= 0' means "pure virtual" = must be implemented by derived classes.
// 'const' at the end means "this function does not modify the object."

    //   (you want the closest hit in this range)
